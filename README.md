# Fixels

Fixels is an application that aims to give quick diabetic retinopathy prediction based on retinal images. We trained a convolutional neural network on top of [kaggle public datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection) and [messidor private datasets](http://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor/). The trained model then became nothing but the heart of our application.

## Technology

In fixels, we use a python server with all the machine learning related modules including [keras](https://keras.io/) and [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to train our model and generate prediction based on that model. For the client-side, it's a simple web application built using [react](https://react.com) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for now. We are planning to develop the mobile version in the future.
